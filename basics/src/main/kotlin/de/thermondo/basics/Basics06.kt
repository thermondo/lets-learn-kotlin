/*
 * You can pass parameters to classes via the class constructor by first giving the parameter name
 * and then the type, similar to how we create functions with parameters.
 *
 * Let's create a class called Basics06, that accepts the following parameters:
 * @param name: String
 * @param age: Int
 * and return the name and age of the two people.
