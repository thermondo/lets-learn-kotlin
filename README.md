In this repository you will solve problems as a way to learn Kotlin. Each
problem is backed by a unit test to insure you get to a correct solution. In
addition to the unit tests, you will find a potential solution. This repository
is split into different levels from basics to advanced topics.

# Basics

In this module you will learn how to:

* Functions and variables
* Classes and properties - TODO
* Enums - TODO
* When - TODO
* Control flow - TODO
* Exceptions - TODO

# Advent of Code

This module contains the Advent of Code problems, to apply the things you've 
learned working through the other modules. See
[Advent of Code](/advent-of-code/ADVENT_OF_CODE.md) for more information.
